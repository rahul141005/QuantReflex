# QuantReflex Decision Log

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).** Each entry captures a decision, the context, the
options considered, and the consequences — so future readers understand *why*, not just *what*.
Newest first. Reference these IDs (`ADR-NNN`) from the CHANGELOG when a change embodies a decision.

## ADR-009 — v2 monetization: single `plan` model, remove lifetime + Premium+ (2026-06-11)
- **Context:** v1 sold two paid tiers — ₹89 lifetime (`isPremium`/`hasPaid`) and ₹299/₹499 "Premium+"
  (`isPremiumPlus`, the only tier with AI). Confusing for users, duplicated gating logic, and split
  schema. Business decided on one paid tier.
- **Decision:** Collapse to a single **Premium** tier (₹299/6mo `premium_6m`, ₹499/12mo `premium_12m`)
  that includes everything. Canonical schema is `plan: 'free'|'premium'` + `planType`, `planExpiry`,
  `planSource`; `isTrial`/`trialEnd` retained for admin-granted custom-duration trials. All removed v1
  fields are deleted. Every gate (client, server, AI, rules, admin, coaching, functions) resolves
  through `plan`. New `aiService.activatePremium`/`resolvePlan` replace `unlockPremium(Plus)`/
  `isUserPremium(Plus)`. Single `premium` JWT claim.
- **Options considered:** (a) repurpose the `isPremium` boolean — rejected, the user wanted a literal
  `plan` field and architectural cleanliness over minimal change; (b) grandfather lifetime buyers —
  N/A, **zero production users**, so a clean pre-launch migration was chosen with no back-compat.
- **Consequence:** Breaking schema change → **v2.0** across all version tracks. Forward docs rewritten;
  historical records (this log, CHANGELOG, AUDIT) retain v1 entries. Dev-data normalized by
  `firestore/migrations/2026-06-11-v2-plan-schema.js`. Math Duel + AI are now plain premium features.

## ADR-008 — Establish `/docs/BIBLE/` as the permanent source of truth (2026-06-11)
- **Context:** Architecture knowledge was spread across code comments and ad-hoc docs; risk of
  drift and of a future session not understanding the system.
- **Decision:** Consolidate four core docs + changelog into `/docs/BIBLE/`, add DECISION_LOG,
  ROADMAP, VERSIONS, GOVERNANCE, README. Enforce a doc-first change workflow.
- **Options considered:** (a) keep docs at `/docs/` root — rejected, no governance structure;
  (b) wiki/external — rejected, must live with the code and survive offline reads.
- **Consequence:** Every change now carries a documentation + version cost; the payoff is a
  cold-readable architecture. Old `/docs/*.md` replaced with redirect stubs to avoid dual truth.

## ADR-007 — Single canonical super-admin auth wrapper (2026-06-11, audit M5)
- **Context:** Two admin wrappers existed; only `firebase-admin#withAdmin` (used by `questions.js`)
  was rate-limited. Sensitive endpoints (entitlements, payments) had none.
- **Decision:** `_lib/middleware.js#withAdminAuth` is canonical (token + `admin:true` + 30/hr,
  sets both `req.userId` and `req.adminUid`); `withAdmin` re-exports it.
- **Consequence:** All super-admin endpoints rate-limited under one implementation.

## ADR-006 — `studentCount` is the single canonical counter, function-owned (2026-06-11, audit M8)
- **Context:** Two divergent fields (`studentCount` from the Cloud Function vs `studentsCount`
  from claim-coaching/admin) produced wrong admin numbers and double-counting.
- **Decision:** `syncCoachingStudentCount` Cloud Function is the **sole writer** of `studentCount`.
  Request handlers must not increment counters. Legacy `studentsCount` removed; reconcile script
  provided.
- **Options considered:** make claim-coaching write the counter (rejected — racy, duplicates the
  function and double-counts).
- **Consequence:** One source of truth; drift repaired by a reconciliation script.

## ADR-005 — Canonical coaching active-state helper (2026-06-11, audit M4)
- **Context:** Three endpoints disagreed; claim/validate checked a `status` value never written,
  so a suspended coaching could be claimed.
- **Decision:** `isCoachingActive(data)` = `status==='active'` when present, else `isActive!==false`.
  Used by register, claim-coaching, validate-coaching.

## ADR-004 — Lifetime premium uses an idempotent, user-bound grant (2026-06-11, audit H1)
- **Context:** Lifetime `premium` granted via `safeUserUpdate` with no payment lock and no
  order→caller binding → cross-account replay of one payment.
- **Decision:** `aiService.unlockPremium` transacts on `payments/{paymentId}` (rejects different-uid
  reuse), and `verify.js` asserts `order.notes.uid === req.userId`. Mirrors the Premium+ design.

## ADR-003 — AI quota enforced transactionally, not via in-memory cache (2026-06-11, audit H2)
- **Context:** Non-transactional check-then-consume let concurrent requests bypass the cap.
- **Decision:** `consumeWordProblemQuota` runs the check+increment inside a Firestore transaction
  and returns the granted count; the endpoint serves only what was granted.

## ADR-002 — Firestore rules are the entitlement authority; claims are an optimization (pre-1.0)
- **Context:** Need fast entitlement checks without 2 Firestore reads per call.
- **Decision:** Firestore is the source of truth; JWT custom claims (`premium`, `premiumPlus`) are a
  best-effort fast path. A stale/missing claim never wrongly grants access — only delays it.
- **Updated by ADR-009 (v2):** the source of truth is now `users/{uid}.plan`, and the claim set
  collapsed to a single `{premium}` (no `premiumPlus`). The "claims are an optimization, Firestore is
  authority" principle still holds.

## ADR-001 — App isolation with inline-copied shared utilities (pre-1.0)
- **Context:** Three apps deploy independently on Vercel; no bundler.
- **Decision:** `shared/` is reference-only; utilities (`_toMillis`, `_escapeHtml`, Firebase config)
  are inline-copied per app. Changes to a shared utility must update every copy.
- **Consequence:** Some duplication accepted in exchange for zero build tooling and independent deploys.
